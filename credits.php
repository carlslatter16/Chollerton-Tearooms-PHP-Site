				<h3>Security considerations</h3> <!--Security info in two paragraphs like asked-->
				<p>
					Security is extreamly important in modern day. You must ensure that both the website, and the server itself are secure in order to protect data integrity, confidentiality and availability.
					Data breaches are a common occurance, and steps have to be taken in order to prevent them happening. The admin page needs to be locked down and not be public, preferbly not using the username 'admin', and must
					use a strong password that is unique. Strong password policy is important for any buisness. Some common hacking methods are sql injection in which sql code is injected into a input field in order to modify
					or view data that they shouldn't be allowed to. This is due to lack of care with usage of user created varaibles inside an SQL statement that are not parameterized.
					<br>
					<br>
					There is also XSS(Cross-Site Scripting) in which javascript is uploaded to a server using typical input, usually in a public place, that is then run on other
					machines client side. This can vary in severity but can mean that data is sent to a remote server so it is very important that it protected against. This is normally, but not limited to, because of lack of
					validation of '< >' characters. I have fixed both of these issues on the site. Another important note is that in order to stay in line with GDPR, you must ask the user if they want to use cookies, should they
					ever be implemented into the site.
